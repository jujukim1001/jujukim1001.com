                <div class="generalDescription">

                  As a student living in a studio with no proper kitchen area, ordering food delivery became my everyday routine. DoorDash was the first food delivery app that I was introduced to in America and ever since then, I remained loyal to DoorDash because of their great list of local restaurants and relatively fast delivery time. I would say that my experience as a consumer was overall pretty good. However, when I talked with my friend who is a Dasher (Delivery personnel), he had a different point of view when he interacts with DoorDash. I‚Äôve helped him a few times dashing, and I found that the Driver app had more usability problems compared to the Consumer app. As a product designer, I became more curious about the Dasher experience of the product and wanted to find design opportunities there.</div>

                <div class="twoSpacer"></div>
                <div class="generalDescription">

                  Before jumping right into redesigning the Driver app, I started off with researching about the company. By doing so, I was able to get better insights into the company‚Äôs mission and how their business works. DoorDash‚Äôs mission is to connect people by empowering local businesses and generate new ways for people to earn through facilitating door-to-door delivery. Their business model targets three different user bases, which are Consumers (Ordering Food), Dashers (Delivering Food), and Merchants (Making Food). With the use of digital platforms, DoorDash tries to facilitate the interaction between consumers and food businesses. </div>

                <div class="boldtext">Importance of Dasher app</div>
                <div class="twoSpacer"></div>
                <div class="generalDescription">

                  In this process, Dashers play a very important role in facilitating the consumer-merchant interactions. Therefore, in order to make this interaction flow smoothly, the product that dashers are using should be efficient and easy to navigate. Not only that, there are many people in the area who dash for a living; therefore, the payment model should be transparent and be helpful for them to maintain their stable earnings.

                        As part of the research, I went on dashing with my friend (who is a Dasher) to experience their journey of how they interact with the Driver App in their working process. Being in the shoes of Dasher, I was able to better understand what struggles they have, and what makes them happy to go forward with their job.
